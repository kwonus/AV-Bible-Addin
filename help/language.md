### Early Modern English

Early-Modern-English, the language spoken at the time of Shakespeare, is known to be more morphologically rich than contemporary Modern-English. There are also some words that are seldomly used today. We'll discuss a few of those, too. For brevity's sake, we will refer to a word in the Early-Modern-English vocabulary as an "Elizabethan Word". Likewise, we will refer to a word in the contemporary Modern-English vocabulary as a "modern Word".

First, let's take a look at second-person pronouns and their precise meanings. Afterwards, we'll see how these outdated pronouns align with today's first-person pronouns:

#### Second-Person pronouns

| Case           | Singular 2nd-Person | Plural 2nd-Person | Modern Equivalent                           |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Subjective** | thou                | ye                | you                                         |
| **Objective**  | thee                | you               | you                                         |
| **Genitive**   | thy                 | your              | your                                        |
| **Possessive** | thine               | yours             | yours                                       |
| **Reflexive**  | thyself             | yourselves        | yourself (singular)<br/>yourselves (plural) |

#### Notice the similarity with First-Person pronouns:

##### Singular Pronouns:

| Case           | Singular 1st-Person | Singular 2nd-Person |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Subjective** | I                   | thou                |
| **Objective**  | me                  | thee                |
| **Genitive**   | my                  | thy                 |
| **Possessive** | mine                | thine               |
| **Reflexive**  | myself              | thyself             |

##### Plural Pronouns:

| Case           | Plural 1st-Person | Plural 2nd-Person |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Subjective** | we                | ye                |
| **Objective**  | us                | you               |
| **Genitive**   | our               | your              |
| **Possessive** | ours              | yours             |
| **Reflexive**  | ourselves         | yourselves        |

##### Singular Verb Conjugations:

| Person / Number           | Usages with Copula           | Modern Equivalent            | Elizabethan Conjugation of regular verbs            | Modern Conjugation                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **1st-Person / Singular** | I am<br/>I was               | I am<br/>I was               | I prepare<br/>I prepared                            | I prepare<br/>I prepared                       |
| **2nd-Person / Singular** | *thou art<br/>thou wast*     | you are<br/>you were         | *thou preparest<br/>thou preparedst*                | you prepare<br/>you prepared                   |
| **3rd-Person / Singular** | he is<br/>she is<br/>Mary is | he is<br/>she is<br/>Mary is | *he prepareth<br/>she prepareth<br/>Mary prepareth* | he prepares<br/>she prepares<br/>Mary prepares |

In general:

- verb conjugations with 1st-person singular are the same as modern English
- verb conjugations with 2nd-person singular, end in ***st*** or ***est***
- verb conjugations with 3rd-person singular, end in ***th*** or ***eth*** (the modern singular verb equivalents end in ***s*** or ***es***)

Let's examine morphology by example:

##### Plural Verb Conjugations:

| Person / Number         | Usages with Copula      | Modern Equivalent       | Elizabethan Conjugation of regular verbs | Modern Conjugation              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **1st-Person / Plural** | we are                  | we are                  | we prepare                               | we prepare                      |
| **2nd-Person / Plural** | *ye* are                | you are                 | *ye* prepare                             | you prepare                     |
| **3rd-Person / Plural** | they are<br/>people are | they are<br/>people are | they prepare<br/>people prepare          | they prepare<br/>people prepare |

In general: While the pronoun-form for second-person plural differs from the modern, all verb conjugation for plural verbs is consistent between Elizabethan English and contemporary English.

It should be noted that the distinction between singular and plural forms of  the second person pronouns affords greater precision in the language. There are times, when studying the scripture, that this clarity of meaning is valuable. For this reason, when text is modernized into AVX by the AV-Bible application, a superscript is utilized to identify singular and plural. The superscript is provided on both second-person pronouns and the also on the conjugated verbs. That way, even when the text is modernized, the precision of the original text is preserved.

By the way, both ancient Hebrew and ancient Greek also distinguished between singular and plural second-person pronoun forms. It might be obvious to the reader, but contemporary English translations are unable to non-verbosely represent this level of precision.

Let's examine a couple Elizabethan words that say a lot in a single word:

| Word (adverb) | Modern equivalent | Precise Meaning    |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| **hither**    | here              | from there to here |
| **thither**   | there             | from here to there |

The AVX button in AV-Bible is able to modernize the text by utilizing a singular bi-text lexicon. Incidentally, the KJV bible is sometimes called "The Authorized Version", because it was authorized by the king. The two most significant editions of the KJV are named by their publication dates, notably: the AV-1611 and the AV-1769.  Aside from an original printing-press typo or two, the two editions contain the vary same words.

However, in the early sixteen hundreds, word spellings had not yet been standardized. In fact, it was emblematic of education to vary spellings. These varied spellings were many in the original AV-1611. In the mid seventeen hundreds, spellings were becoming standardized. Moreover, English orthography was updated during that same period [somewhat analogous to fonts, but some letters morphed; that orthographical is what we use in contemporary English today]. Consequently, the publication of the AV-1769 contained updated/standardized spellings and updated orthography. 

Yet, word for word, the AV-1611 and the AV-1769 are the same book. Yet, most modern English speakers would struggle a bit to decipher the AV-1611. Much less so with the AV-1769, that is the basis for every modern KJV publication today.

The idea for AVX was indeed inspired by the 1769 edition. In fact I view the modernized text to be very analogous to the yet a third major edition of the AV. Since AVX is not a true translation, but a mechanical mapping of a seventeenth century text into a modern lexicon, the mapping is not always clean. It's precise, yet sometimes the result is harder to understand than the original Elizabethan text of the KJV.  For this reason, AVX is considered to be a study-help for the KJV, not to be equated as new edition/version of the bible.  Where AVX-modernization works, it works wonderfully, where it fails, it's best to consult the passage directly in the KJV. AV-Bible 2024 provides side-by-side KJX and AVX verse-renderings (with or without difference highlighting).

AVX stands for AV eXtensions.  It is not a new translation. It is not a new edition of the KJV. It is merely a study help for understanding the very words of the very bible that fueled the greatest missionary period that the world has ever seen.

**Psalm 12:6-7**

> The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

The one remaining hurdle to understanding the KJV is an aspect of contemporary modern English that we are all used to. With very few exceptions, the subject ALWAYS precedes the verb. Not so in Elizabethan English. While the subject usually precedes the verb, it does not always. At times, this remains intuitive to the reader. Notwithstanding, longer sentences where the verb precedes the subject can be quite confusing. Unfortunately, it seems that modernizing the text with AVX makes some of these passages more difficult to understand the the original language found in the KJV. Again, AVX is a study tool for illuminating meaning for contemporary English readers. It turns out that learning to understand Early Modern English itself is the best way to understand the words of the KJV. While the author of AV-Bible 2024 believes that AVX is a help for modern readers, he himself uses a KJV in his personal reading and devotions (not an AVX modernization). Still he often quotes with AVX rendering, when speaking with those unfamiliar with Elizabethan English.
