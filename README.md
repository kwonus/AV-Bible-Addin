This Addin requires 64-bit Windows and .Net Framework 4.8, which is installed by default in all versions of Windows 11 and the May 2019 Update of Windows 10 (Win10/1903)

This application also requires Microsoft Word 2010 or newer. However, it has only been tested with Windows 11 and the latest versions of Microsoft Word.

If your installation of Windows does not have the .Net Framework 4.8 installed, you must install it by default for any hopes of this addin to function correctly.

This Addin may appear to work on 32-bit Windows. However, the AV Data-Manager is designed for 64-bit Windows. The Addin obtains much of its functionality from the AV Data-Manager.
Therefore, the Addin will not function correctly on 32-bit Windows.
