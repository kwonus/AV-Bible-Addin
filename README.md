So you don't want to fiddle with the source code, and Windows installer is available here:

http://digital-av.org/installer/AVX-Addin-For-Microsoft-Word.msi

The 1.0 release allows insertion of bible verses into your currently-open Microsoft Word document. No more Copy&Paste; just by click a button, specific chapter & verse, and voila!

I wrote the code in just a couple days, so it's not the prettiest.  Still, I had done this before with a much older SDK, and there's not much to it.  But you'll likely have to wait for Fall-2021 until I add search capability also from inside of Word.
